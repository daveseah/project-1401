## Project 1401 - Javascript Video Game Shell

I am an interactive designer and reluctant programmer that, on my [10-year blogging anniversary][10year], realized that I was not getting some dream projects done. One of the oldest ones is making my own video game. While I don't consider myself a die-hard programmer and have avoided it when possible, I'm seeing that I can't avoid it. Thanks to some recent project work, I've started to pick up some modern web application skills, so I'm using them to kick-start a Javascript-based code base for game design exploration.

Although there are a lot of tutorials on the Internet, they often do not teach you how to build an actual working system from scratch. There are also many powerful game engines available, but they don't often explain their founding architectural concepts either. I am hoping that this project will help fill that void, because I am totally obsessive about connecting all the dots together in working code. For more background information, see my [Project 1401][project1401] home page.
