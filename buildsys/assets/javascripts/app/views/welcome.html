      <h4>About Durandal</h4>
          This project is using Durandal, "a cross-device, cross-platform client framework written in JavaScript and designed to make Single Page Applications (SPAs) easy." Of the web frameworks I looked at, this one made the most sense to me. It's very clean and clear, and it also is designed for modular Javascript from the ground-up using RequireJS. Check out  <a href="http://www.durandaljs.com">the official site</a> and their <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/durandaljs">google group</a> for more information.
